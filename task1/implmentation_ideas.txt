Idea 1 - Using BoW with a threshold:

    As part of fitting, each word introduced in training will be inserted into
    BoW so long as its appearance count is below a certain threshold.

    We can use BoW to turn each tweet into a feature vector, and boost the
    result using Adaboost or bagging.

Idea 2 - Using validation with several classifiers:

    10% of the data will be used as validation set
    Classifier 1 - Naive bayes
    Classifier 2 - CNN using N-grams of 1, 2, and with/without TF-IDF
