Idea 1 - Using BoW with a threshold:

    As part of fitting, each word introduced in training will be inserted into
    BoW so long as its appearance count is below a certain threshold.

    We can use BoW to turn each tweet into a feature vector, and boost the
    result using Adaboost or bagging.
